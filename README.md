## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The project requires ```numpy```, ```OpenCV```, ```matplotlib```, ```keras```

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
The aim of the project is to implement a deep neural network to drive a car autonomously, and use fit_generator toload few images at a time.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
- [model.py] - The neural network uses convolution layers with appropriate filter sizes. Layers exist to introduce nonlinearity into the model. The data is normalized in the model.
